## About me

I'm Aowen. A 2nd year student in NTU (Nanyang Technological University) majoring in Mathematical Science with a specialization in Business Analytics. I dabble in a little web-design and am currently setting my foot into the Data Analytics world. I have an unquenching thirst for finding out the "how?" and have been called the human wikipedia at times.. ðŸ˜°

On my free time (rare) you can find me taking a ride on my motorcycle enjoying the night breeze, going to the gym, or hitting bags at a Muay Thai gym.   

ðŸ”­ Currently working on a hackathon project to create a notes generating app that takes lecture recordings and uses AI to turn them into condensed lecture notes packed full of awesome features. Stay tuned!
